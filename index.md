# Welcome to the Azorian API

This project provides a simple example API including:

- Weather forecasting sample endpoint.
- Full **BREAD** operations for managing users.
- Registration and authentication with JWT bearer tokens.
- Administrative endpoints to suspend or ban users.

All HTTP endpoints are served under the `/1` path prefix. For example, the users
endpoint can be reached at `GET /1/users`.

Refer to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for how to
write markdown files.
